Project Description

	I really don't understand most of what is going on here, so it is hard to explain.
	Connects to a local server, connects to MongoDB, and listens for API calls and 
	validates them against User.
	
	I started from scratch and followed the assignments hoping that it would clear things up, 
	but it is still confusing. I understand what is happening, but not how it is happening.
